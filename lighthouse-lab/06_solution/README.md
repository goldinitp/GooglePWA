## Auditing with Lighthouse
In this project you will use the Lighthouse tool to audit a responsive blog site
and and convert it into a Progressive Web App.

## Getting started
Once you've cloned the repo, checkout the starting branch:

`$ git checkout 02_setting-up`

Start a local server in the project directory and navigate to the appropriate local host port (e.g. http://localhost:8000/). You should see a responsive blog site.

Install the [Lighthouse Chrome extension](http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Test the blog site by clicking on the Lighthouse icon in your task bar, and choosing to generate a report. This will cause the Lighthouse tool to audit the blog site. Now you can make the changes listed to convert this site into a Progressive Web App.
