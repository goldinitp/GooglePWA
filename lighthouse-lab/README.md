## Auditing with Lighthouse

In this project you use the Lighthouse tool to audit a responsive blog site
and and convert it into a Progressive Web App.

## Getting started

Clone the repository and navigate to **lighthouse-lab/app**.

Start a local web server at the app base directory. Then, open your browser and
navigate to the appropriate local host port (for example, http://localhost:8080/). You should see a responsive blog site.

Install the [Lighthouse Chrome extension](http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

[Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
