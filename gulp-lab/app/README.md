# Tooling and automation
This lab walks you through automating tasks with [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/master/docs), a build tool and task runner.

## Getting started
Once you've cloned the repo, navigate to the starting folder, **app/**.

Install [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (nvm) if itâ€™s not already installed. Then use nvm to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```
nvm install node
```

Confirm that the installations were successful with:

```
node -v
```

and

```
npm -v
```

These should return version numbers if they are installed. Then install the gulp command line tool:

```
npm install --global gulp-cli
```

To run the solution, navigate to the **solution/** folder and run:

```
npm install
```

followed by:

```
gulp
```
