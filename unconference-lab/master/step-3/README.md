# Step 3

Add a manifest.


## Objectives

* Configure the homescreen experience: icon and app name.

* Configure the launch experience: splash screen, colours, icons.

* Test in all target browsers.


## Things to check

* Make sure you understand all the values in the [manifest](manifest.json).

* Note that the start_url value in the manifest can be handy for deep linking.

* The start_url value can also have a query parameter, for example to track traffic from the homescreen icon.

* Do you think users are likely to use the *Add to Home screen* menu item? Find out more [here](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/increasing-engagement-with-app-install-banners-in-chrome-for-android) about how add-to-homescreen prompting works, and how to defer the prompt event.

* Standalone versus browser mode â€” what's the difference? Why might you choose to stick with browser mode?

* What browsers support Web App Manifests? What about Safari?
