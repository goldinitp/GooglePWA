      <p>For most of the web, poor network connectivity destroys the user experience. We can do better. In this session we'll take an online-only site and turn it into a fully network-resilient, offline-first installable progressive web app. We'll also break out of the app shell and look at approaches that better-suit traditional server-driven sites.</p>

      </a>
      <p>HTTPS is a must-have for progressive web apps. “But,” you say, “it'll make my site slow! And it's going to cost a ton! And does it really give me any security benefits?” In this talk, we debunk some common myths and fears about HTTPS, show you why it's an essential feature for progressive web apps, and dispense some tips and tricks for getting a shiny green lock on your site.</p>

      </a>
      <p>ServiceWorker give you a variety of levers over the loading performance of your app. But HTTP already allowed you to speed up the loading of your app – and these two technologies stack, so you should know what you have at your disposal. With HTTP/2, things only get better. This talk will summarize, the past, the present and the future of protocol-level optimizations.</p>

      <p>As people move through different environments, their ability to access and interact with our mobile apps can change dramatically. While it's important to consider performance, and offline support, we also need to make sure that the components we design are built with inclusivity in mind, so they work for all users regardless of physical or situational disabilities. This talk will explore the diverse range of mobile app users and the ways in which they interact with their devices. We'll highlight how you can leverage what's already built into the platform to assure the largest audience possible has access to your content, while also exploring techniques you can use to extend the platform when you need to go off-road.</p>
