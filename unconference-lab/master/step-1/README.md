# Step 1

HTML only: text, images, video. This is already a functional website! Any subsequent changes must not degrade performance or usability.

## Objectives

* Content design: text, images and media.

* HTML design: tags add meaning to content, HTML is to add meaning and structure, not for layout.

* File structure: standardise names, standardise image formats. This will help templating and debugging.

* Make a habit of upstream checking.


## What to check

* Discount testing! Colleagues, friends and family.

* Get someone to check the text. Avoid trivial mistakes, standardise capitalization. Keep it short.

* Test links (use an extension) and check for broken images.

* Check other content. Are the images who or what they're meant to be? Are video assets as they should be? Are image and video resolutions and quality correct? Are aspect ratios (ratio of width to height) all correct?

* Validate code. Use the same file extensions and file types for the same kind of image. Standardize file naming. Valid code is crucial for debugging responsive design.

* Given the performance and data cost requirements, what are the challenges? Can you spot some problems?
