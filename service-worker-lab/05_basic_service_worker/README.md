## Simple service worker
In this project you will learn how to create a basic service worker script, install it, and do simple debugging.


## Getting started
Once you've cloned the repo, checkout the starting branch:

`$ git checkout 02_setting-up`

Start a local server in the project directory and navigate to the appropriate local host port (e.g. http://localhost:8000/). Use incognito browsing in this lab unless stated otherwise. It ensures that your program is starting from a known state.
