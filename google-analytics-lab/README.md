## Integrating Google Analytics

In this lab you learn how to create a Google Analytics account and integrate Google Analytics into an app. You also learn how to use analytics in service workers and how to use offline analytics.

## Getting started

Clone the repository and navigate to **google-analytics-lab/app**.

Start a local web server at the app base directory. Then, open your browser and
navigate to the appropriate local host port (for example, http://localhost:8080/).

To use the app, you will need a [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) account, and a [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) account.
