## Integrating Google Analytics
In this project you will learn how to create a Google Analytics account and integrate Google Analytics into your app. You will also learn how to use custom events (specifically for push notifications) and offline analytics.

## Getting started
Once you've cloned the repo, checkout the starting branch:

`$ git checkout app`

Start a local server in the project directory and navigate to the appropriate local host port (e.g. http://localhost:8000/).

To use the app, you will need a [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) account, and a [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) account.

To run the solution code, first you need to:

* Replace *UA-XXXXXXXX-Y* with your Google Analytics property/tracking ID in **index.html** and **pages/other.html**.

* Replace *YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID* with your Firebase project ID in **manifest.json**.
